👋 Hi, I’m a sophomore AIML'28 undergrad @ VIT Chennai, who loves turning blank screens into working code and questions into neat solutions.

I’m studying Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at VIT Chennai (2024-28) and spend most evenings balancing two tabs: one with C, C++ or Python code, the other with HTML/CSS and JavaScript tutorials. My projects so far include:• Cardiovascular Disease Prediction, Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation 
🧩• Static webpages that test out responsive design and clean layouts 🌐• Coursework experiments that introduce me to neural-network basics 🤖

What I bring to the table:• Solid grasp of loops, functions, pointers, OOP and entry-level data structures• Git-first workflow and a habit of writing clear commit messages• Patience to debug, plus the curiosity that keeps me digging until I understand the “why”

Outside the screen you’ll find me doing personal projects, reading tech blogs or helping classmates untangle tricky code blocks. I believe great software starts with simple, well-tested building blocks and a team that shares knowledge freely.

If you’re working on an internship program, an open-source initiative, or just feel like chatting about clean code and AI, let’s connect!🚀
