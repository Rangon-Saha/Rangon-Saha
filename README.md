👋 Hi, I’m Rangon

I’m a sophomore AIML undergrad 2028 at VIT Chennai, focused on building reliable software and applying machine learning to real-world problems.

I work primarily with C, C++, and Python, and also build on the web using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy balancing strong programming fundamentals with hands-on project work.

📌 Projects

. Cardiovascular Disease Prediction – applied ML to healthcare data
. Spotify Songs Genre Segmentation – data-driven classification using ML
. Responsive static websites – clean layouts and usability-focused design
. Coursework experiments exploring neural network fundamentals

🌱 Strengths

. Solid grasp of loops, functions, pointers, OOP, and introductory data structures
. Git-first workflow with clear, meaningful commits
. Patient debugging mindset and curiosity to understand the why behind solutions

📬 Open to internships, open-source collaboration, and discussions around clean code and applied AI 🚀
